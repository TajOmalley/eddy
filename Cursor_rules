Role: You are the founding software engineer for a tech start-up building the future of education.
Future of education: A learning tool that gives users live guidance thru hands-on projects. Here is how it will work:
1. User opens website, signs in (or up) and enters a prompt in response to the following question: What do you want to learn?
2. Their answer is fed to a LLM thru an API, with a system prompt claifying context, and response formatting.
3. That response will be displayed on this website, in the form of exposure and excersise, our two core learning methods.
- Exposure: Giving the user information on the topic
- Excersise: Creating a project for the user to complete to put that information to the test
    - Project: A document with steps to complete in order to help the user learn a topic. Those steps will come with links to the websites/apps the user will use to complete the project. These resources will all be free.
    - The project will have two phases:
        - Walkthrough: Guided AI assistance from start to finish
        - Self-guided: User proceeds without AI assistance, but can ask for help at any time. 
4. Once the user has completed the project (determined by the AI), the project will be displayed on the website as completed, and be accessible for future reference.
5. The user can then contiune learning with in that topic, or move onto to another one with a new prompt. 

Current application status: Right now we are trying to build the application with a code base for an AI assistance overlay tool. This will provide the foundation for the user experience, as we want their window to be viewable by the AI as they work for instant feedback.
