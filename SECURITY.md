# Security Notice

## API Key Leak - FIXED

**Date**: December 2024  
**Status**: RESOLVED

### Issue
Firebase API keys and configuration were hardcoded in the source code and committed to the repository, making them publicly visible.

### Resolution
- ✅ Moved all Firebase configuration to environment variables
- ✅ Added environment variable validation
- ✅ Updated .gitignore to prevent future leaks
- ✅ Removed hardcoded keys from source code

### Required Actions
1. **Regenerate Firebase Keys**: The exposed keys should be considered compromised
2. **Set Environment Variables**: Configure the following environment variables:
   - `FIREBASE_API_KEY`
   - `FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
   - `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
   - `FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
   - `FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
   - `FIREBASE_APP_ID`
   - `FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID`

### Prevention
- All sensitive configuration is now stored in environment variables
- Environment files are properly ignored in .gitignore
- Added validation to ensure required environment variables are present

### Impact
- **Before**: Firebase keys were publicly visible in repository
- **After**: All configuration is secure and environment-based
